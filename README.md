### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of New Haven working towards a B.S. in Chemistry.
Currently I am woring with Dr. Seifert on rebuilding a microwave spectrometer, and we are working on comunicating digitally with all of the older aspects of the instrument so as to be able to remotely manage and run experiments.
If you need to reach out to me feel free to use my university email: jmcew1@unh.newhaven.edu
